            <p id="aboutarctic">Arctic Monkeys â€” English indie rock band from Sheffield. Formed in 2002 by vocalist Alex Turner, guitarist Jamie Cook and bassist Andy Nicholson. The band currently consists of Turner, Cook, O'Malley, Helders. Bassist Andy Nicholson left the band shortly after they released their debut album in 2006. The Arctic Monkeys began to gain popularity as they handed out CDs, containing their 18 demo tracks, at various gigs. The group also gained quite a following on the social media platform MySpace, and are now described as one of the first bands to come to the public's attention through the Internet. Their lyrics, particularly in the earlier albums, often reflected the everyday experiences of life in Sheffield, capturing the essence of Northern English culture. Turner often drew inspiration from the local surroundings, creating narratives that resonate with the working-class spirit of the city.</p>

                <p id="queen">Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970 by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mercury>Freddie Mercury</a> (lead vocals, piano), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_May">Brian May</a> (guitar, vocals), and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Taylor_(Queen_drummer)>Roger Taylor</a> (drums, vocals), later joined by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Deacon>John Deacon</a> (bass). Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock, and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock. The band became popular with audiences via their hit singles, live performances, originality and showmanship, being voted the greatest British band of all time in a national BBC poll. Their Live Aid (1985) performance was voted the best live rock performance of all time in an industry poll. The bandâ€™s profile grew considerably in 2018 when the Queen biopic <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1727824/">Bohemian Rhapsody</a> arrived in theaters. The movie took tremendous liberties with the truth, but audiences were stunned by Rami Malekâ€™s portrayal of Freddie Mercury, and the recreation of pivotal Queen moments, like their 1985 set at Live Aid. The movie grossed nearly a billion dollars, won Malek an Oscar for Best Actor, and helped Queen + Lambert play to the biggest audiences May and Taylor had seen since the glory days of Queen. Itâ€™s an incredible final chapter for the band that few saw coming</p>
